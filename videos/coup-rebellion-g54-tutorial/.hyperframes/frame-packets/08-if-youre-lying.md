**narrativeRole** — Completes the challenge pair so the viewer can price the risk before they ever bluff.

**keyMessage** — A caught bluff costs the bluffer, not the challenger.

**Adapt:** keep the per-beat full-screen build; the frame flips to the `fire-orange` accent register to signal the inverse outcome. Layout: centred, hard cut to full accent field. (Blueprint swapped from kinetic-type-beats for the packet budget; ticker-takeover keeps the violent-replacement signature.)

Scene 1 (0.0–1.6s): the same `challenge` stamp lands via **kinetic beat-slam** (`kinetic-beat-slam`), but the field **hard-cuts** to the **accent register** — `ink-black` type on `fire-orange` (`scale-swap-transition`). The revealed card is blank, a redaction bar over it.
Scene 2 (1.6–3.6s): on "you lose the life", the claimant's own card turns face-up via **card flip** (`split-tilt-cards`) — `−1 influence` in mono.
Scene 3 (3.6–5.0s): on "the action fails", `action fails` slams in the display ramp (`kinetic-beat-slam`), and the three coins slide back to the `mk-orange` treasury.
Scene 4 (5.0–6.2s): the accent field holds, type still. Deliberate held read — stillness, at most **subtle jitter** (`sine-wave-loop`).

## Selected blueprint: ticker-takeover

# ticker-takeover — Ticker Displace / Takeover

**intent**: A context phrase types in, an accent word cycles through options like a slot-machine to suggest "this could be many things," then a hero CRASHES in from off-screen and physically shoves the text aside — "actually, this is what it is." A collision, not a fade.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `takeover-ticker-displace`): when a static lead-in phrase + a cycling accent word should be **physically replaced** (not cross-dissolved) by a hero arriving with momentum, and the final frame is the hero alone. Reach for it when the takeover should read as an impact.
- Brand_Outro: the same collision used as a sign-off — options cycle, the brand mark crashes in and owns the frame.

**duration**: 5–7s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; one text group on the left/center that gets ejected by an incoming hero)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.4s) — context build.** A typewriter lays down a `[lead-in phrase]` character-by-character (smooth, no typos — selling confidence, not human chaos). Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.4–3.0s) — the cycling beat.** An `[accent word]` slot inside the line ticks through 2–3 `[options]` on a vertical spring-roll (each click a new word), suggesting breadth — "many things this could be." (More than ~3 reads as filler.)
- **Scene 3 (~3.0–4.2s) — the collision (signature move).** A `[hero]` crashes in from off-screen with momentum and physically SHOVES the whole text group aside — the text reacts to the impact (gets displaced), it does not fade. The hero lands **heavy** — a longer settle, not a zip — so it reads as mass, not speed.
- **Scene 4 (~4.2–end) — the hero alone.** The hero settles dead-center and reads still. Holds.

**motion vocabulary**: smooth character typewriter; vertical spring-ticker word roll (2–3 steps); off-screen hero crash-in with momentum; reactive displacement of the struck text group; heavy long-tail landing (not bouncy); dual-axis subtle jitter on the resting hero.

**rule mapping**

- smooth single-phrase typewriter lead-in → `discrete-text-sequence` (smooth-slice / continuous `floor(progress)` form — no typo machinery)
- accent word slot-machine cycling through options → `vertical-spring-ticker` (`STEPS` = number of options the hero will replace; the rule's footer-reveal is unused — Scene 3 takes its place)
- hero shoves the text group aside on impact → `reactive-displacement` (the text is the displaced mass; express the hero's "heavy land" as a longer `power2` settle, not the rule's default `back.out`)
- hero's fast off-screen crash-in → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur resolving sharp as it lands)
- resting-hero aliveness → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude dual-frequency register — scale + rotation jitter composing onto the hero's final landed scale; never a yoyo around 1)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the displacement happens in element space (the hero moves the text), so there is no real camera move; the impact is the only motion.

# Kinetic Beat Slam

Short phrases hit one at a time on a **steady beat**, each with a _different_ entrance, then stack into a locked finale — the recipe for "punchy / rhythmic" text-forward pieces (taglines, manifestos, hype intros). The difference between generic and rhythmic is (1) one shared **onset array** driving every element, (2) **distinct** entrances per phrase rather than one reused helper, and (3) optional **rhythm chrome** that visibly keeps the beat.

## How It Works

A single tempo grid — `PULSE` seconds per sub-beat, `BEATS = [t0, t1, t2, …]` on that grid — is the rhythmic spine; every phrase entrance, accent, and chrome tick reads its time from it, so the piece locks to one pulse instead of drifting hand-tuned offsets. Each phrase gets a different transform axis (scale+blur slam / side snap / rise+rotate) with short attacks (0.35–0.6s on the hit), then the stack holds with a finite low-amplitude breath.

// ONE tempo grid drives everything — phrases AND the metronome read it.

## Variations

- **Entrance easing by attack character** — `power4.out` hard slam ⭐ default hit · `expo.out` hardest snap (side-snaps, whip-ins) · `back.out(2)` overshoot pop (accents only, not body words) · `circ.out` heavy rise with momentum. Use **at least 3 distinct easings** across the piece.
- **Rhythm chrome alternatives** — a center beat bar or a `// label` monospace tag pulsing on-beat instead of the 5-tick metronome; mark any decorative that must survive a shader transition per `../transitions/overview.md`.
- **Finale dressing** — stack + accent underline sweep ([css-marker-patterns](css-marker-patterns.md)); don't just leave the last phrase sitting.

## Critical Constraints

- **One beat array, not scattered offsets** — every element times off `BEATS[]` / `PULSE`; this is the single biggest lever for "rhythmic".
- **Different entrance per phrase** — a reused `punchIn()` for all lines is the flat-but-competent tell. Vary the motion axis, reuse the ease _family_.
- **Finale repeat math**: `repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(dur / cycle) - 1)` — `Math.ceil` overshoots `data-duration` and trips the `gsap_repeat_ceil_overshoot` lint rule; a negative repeat is read by GSAP as `-1` (infinite).
- **No banned exit animations between scenes** — in a montage the _transition_ is the exit (`../transitions/overview.md`); only a final scene may fade out.
- **Display font must be embedded** or it silently falls back at render — Anton / Bebas-as-literal are NOT embedded (`Bebas Neue` aliases to League Gothic; verify in `typography.md`).

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

name: scale-swap-transition
description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.
metadata:
  tags: transition, morph, scale, swap, spring, pop
---

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# Sine Wave Loop (subtle jitter / bounded ambient)

> **Reach for this last.** Per the motion doctrine (`references/motion-language.md`): circular breathing — scaling text/cards up and down to look "alive" — is cheap, the agent's reflexive cheat, and reads weak. "I'd rather have NO motion than BAD motion." First fill the back of a shot with **sequential reveal timed to the VO**; if a frame has genuinely settled and still needs life, the **sanctioned move is subtle jitter** — this rule at the LOW end of its amplitude range. A full breathing loop is the rare last resort on a single held hero, never stamped on every element.

Keeps a settled element from feeling dead using `Math.sin` on the timeline clock. Two forms:

- **Yoyo form** — one `sine.inOut` tween with `yoyo: true` and a **finite** `repeat` count. Preferred when the idle stands alone on a property nothing else touches.
- **onUpdate form** — one long `ease: "none"` tween drives a `phase` proxy `0 → 2π·CYCLES`; `onUpdate` maps `Math.sin(phase)` into the transform. Required when the offset multiplies/adds onto another live value (compound transforms, amplitude envelopes, multi-octave).

Either way, idle begins where the entry settled: at `phase = 0`, `sin(0) = 0` — the offset is zero, so there is no jump from the entry's resting state.

## Recipe

```js
// onUpdate form — phase-driven, composable.
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES,
    duration: IDLE_DUR,
    ease: "none", // sine provides the easing; a non-linear phase tween distorts the wave
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      hero.style.transform = `translateY(${s * Y_AMP_PX}px) scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
      // secondary elements: offset by Math.PI / 2 — synced motion looks mechanical
      dot.style.transform = `scale(${1 + Math.sin(phase.p + Math.PI / 2) * DOT_SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);

// Yoyo form — standalone property, finite repeats.
tl.to(
  "#badge",
  { y: -Y_AMP_PX, duration: PERIOD / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: REPEATS },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multi-octave** (organic): stack a higher-frequency overlay — `1 + Math.sin(p) * AMP_PRIMARY + Math.sin(p * OCTAVE_RATIO) * AMP_SECONDARY`, with `AMP_SECONDARY < AMP_PRIMARY` and the combined max inside the normal SCALE_AMP range.
- **Settle and fade** (strongly recommended when `IDLE_DUR > 6s`): ramp amplitude to zero over the last ~20% of idle so the scene visibly settles before the inter-scene transition, instead of handing off mid-drift:

```js
const t = phase.p / (Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES); // 0 → 1 across idle
const env = t < 1 - FADE_FRAC ? 1 : (1 - t) / FADE_FRAC; // FADE_FRAC ≈ 0.2
const scale = 1 + Math.sin(phase.p) * SCALE_AMP * env;
```

This is the single biggest fix when finalize snapshots show "everything's still moving at the end"; it pairs naturally with break-boundary transitions (the outgoing visual is static when the crossfade/push begins).

## Critical Constraints

- **Prefer reveal, then jitter, then breath** — the doctrine order above; default to the LOW end of every amplitude range. At the upper end across 5+ consecutive scenes the whole film reads as "shimmering".
- **Long idle window** (`IDLE_DUR > 6s` OR idle > 30% of composition): halve `SCALE_AMP` / `Y_AMP_PX`, slow the period to 3–4s, and add the settle-and-fade tail.
- **Concurrent idle on N elements** (columns, card grid, stat row): per-element amplitude ≤ default `/ √N`, AND stagger the periods (2.1s / 1.9s / 2.4s). Three columns at ±6px compound to ±18px of competing motion; three at ±2–3px read as one collective breath.
- **Compose, don't replace** — idle ADDS to the element's resting transform; never overwrite the entry's final translation.
- **Phase tween `ease: "none"`** — sine itself is the curve.
- **No CSS `@keyframes` for idle** — CSS animation runs on the browser's render clock, independent of the HF seek clock; a CSS-driven idle flickers/desyncs. Drive idle inside the timeline.

# Split Tilt Cards

Two cards side-by-side with opposing `rotateY` (left `+TILT`, right `−TILT`) — a symmetric "book-open" 3D split for comparisons, before/after, feature pairs. Each card slides in from its own side (reinforcing "they came from their own worlds and met here"), then the pair idles in counter-phase.

## How It Works

`perspective` on the scene root (REQUIRED — without it `rotateY` flattens to a 2D layout) and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the stage and both cards. Entry starts each card off-axis with `TILT + TILT_OVERSHOOT`, settling to `TILT` — a pivot-into-place. Idle is a gentle counter-phase y-bob (the two yoyo tweens run in opposite directions); copy fades up during the cards' settle, not after.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="split-stage">
  <div class="card card-left">
    <div class="card-eyebrow">{leftEyebrow}</div>
    <div class="card-headline">{leftHeadline}</div>
    <div class="card-body">{leftBody}</div>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-right">…</div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene-root {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  perspective: SCENE_PERSPECTIVE; /* REQUIRED */
}
.split-stage {
  display: flex;
  gap: STAGE_GAP;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
.card {
  width: CARD_WIDTH;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  will-change: transform;
}
/* Shadow falls WITH the facing direction: left card faces right → shadow right. */
.card-left {
  box-shadow: -CARD_SHADOW_OFFSET CARD_SHADOW_DROP CARD_SHADOW_BLUR {shadowColor};
}
.card-right {
  box-shadow: CARD_SHADOW_OFFSET CARD_SHADOW_DROP CARD_SHADOW_BLUR {shadowColor};
}
```

```js
// Entry — from outside, opposing tilts settle with a small pivot
tl.fromTo(
  ".card-left",
  { x: -ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST, rotateY: TILT + TILT_OVERSHOOT, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, rotateY: TILT, opacity: 1, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  LEFT_AT,
);
tl.fromTo(
  ".card-right",
  { x: ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST, rotateY: -TILT - TILT_OVERSHOOT, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, rotateY: -TILT, opacity: 1, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  RIGHT_AT,
);

// Counter-phase idle bob — opposite signs = alive; synchronized = conveyor belt
tl.to(
  ".card-left",
  { y: -FLOAT_AMP, duration: FLOAT_DURATION / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  IDLE_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".card-right",
  { y: FLOAT_AMP, duration: FLOAT_DURATION / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  IDLE_START,
);

// Copy fades up during the settle
tl.from(
  ".card-eyebrow, .card-headline, .card-body",
  { opacity: 0, y: COPY_RISE, stagger: COPY_STAGGER, duration: COPY_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  COPY_REVEAL_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Badges / floating labels**: position them on the PARENT, never inside a card — inside they inherit the `rotateY` and tilt off-axis.
- **3+ cards**: center card stays flat (`rotateY: 0`), outer two tilt inward — "old way / nothing / our way."
- **Zoom-through**: a separate camera tween scaling `.split-stage` reads as the viewer crossing the gap between the tilted pair.

## Values

| token             | range                            | notes                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SCENE_PERSPECTIVE | 1000–2400px                      | lower exaggerates the tilt; higher reads near-isometric |
| TILT              | 10–18°                           | < 10 reads almost flat; > 18 folds shut and copy blurs  |
| TILT_OVERSHOOT    | 4–12°                            | the pivot-into-place feel                               |
| STAGE_GAP         | 40–120px (~0.06–0.15×CARD_WIDTH) | small = fused pair; large = compared-but-separate       |
| CARD_WIDTH        | 480–820px @1920                  | `2×CARD_WIDTH + STAGE_GAP ≤ 0.95×stage` at full tilt    |
| ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST  | 200–500px (~0.3–0.6×CARD_WIDTH)  |                                                         |
| ENTRY_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                         |                                                         |
| RIGHT_AT          | LEFT_AT + 0–0.3s                 | zero feels mechanical; large fragments the pair         |
| FLOAT_AMP         | 3–8px                            | subtle is the point                                     |
| FLOAT_DURATION    | 1.6–3.2s round trip              | breathing cadence; IDLE_START ≥ entry end               |
| COPY_REVEAL_AT    | during the entry tail            | copy popping in after cards are idle reads disconnected |

## Critical Constraints

- **`perspective` on the scene root is REQUIRED**; `preserve-3d` on the stage AND each card.
- **Shadow direction matches tilt** — left card faces right → shadow falls right (and mirrored). Wrong sign reads as broken 3D.
- **Counter-phase idle** — the two bobs run with opposite signs at the same position.
- **Badges outside the card divs** (they'd inherit the rotation).
- **Body copy ≤ 2 lines per card** — tilted long paragraphs collapse into perspective blur.
- **Symmetric weight** — same width, same vertical center, similar line counts; asymmetry breaks the comparison metaphor.
